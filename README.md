# ISTAT_lab ðŸ’»
As student of Data Science I had the opportunity of joining the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) to analyse data coming from the [Rilevazione Forze Lavoro](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/8263), meaning the surveying about the laborforce. I had the task of comparing the performances of regions in central Italy before and after Covid-19.

I uploaded both the presentation we showed to the professors and to the ISTAT employees - my work is contained from slide 19 to 33 - and the Python code.

Feel free to look at the code and to give me any feedback.
